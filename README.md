# PlantCatalogueDemo
A RESTful API demo using PostgreSQL, Express, React, NodeJS, and Heroku [PERN Stack hosted on Heroku]

## Trello board

## Approach to the problem
- First is to plan on what I want the app to do, what it should look like, and what end points are needed. The trello board is a quick and easy way to keep track.
- I used Heroku as the host because it's free and easy to setup. React + Bootstrap for the front end because it is fast to make and responsive.

- The page will generate a card for each plant in the database
- Users can edit the desciption or delete the card.

Time spend ~13 Hours
